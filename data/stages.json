They pioneered statistical models to convert complex credit data into a single, objective three-digit score. This innovation revolutionized lending: banks gained a uniform yardstick to evaluate risk, and consumers could better understand—and improve—their financial reputation."

This includes payment histories, loan balances, account openings, bankruptcies, and collection actions.\n\nCredit Repository: Collected data is organized into detailed credit reports for each consumer. Think of it as a comprehensive transcript documenting every loan, credit card, and payment event over decades."

These algorithms weight factors:\n\nPayment History (35%): On-time vs. late payments.\nAmounts Owed (30%): Credit utilization ratios across revolving accounts.\nLength of Credit History (15%): Age of oldest, newest, and average accounts.\nCredit Mix (10%): Diversity of installment vs. revolving credit.\nNew Credit (10%): Recent inquiries and newly opened accounts."

            "content": "The model outputs a three-digit score—from 300 (high risk) to 850 (low risk). This number reflects the statistical probability of timely repayment: higher scores mean lower default risk.\n\nLenders set cutoffs and criteria based on score bands. For example, a mortgage lender may require a score of 620+ for conventional loans, while auto lenders might approve down to 580 at higher interest rates."
