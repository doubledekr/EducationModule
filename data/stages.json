That extra share was the first form of interest, a reward for risk and deferred consumption."

In medieval Europe, the Christian Church's ban on usury (charging any interest) forced creative workarounds: Italian moneylenders in Florence, like the Medici family, invented bills of exchange and merchant banking to fund crusades and trade, embedding implicit interest in complex financial instruments."
