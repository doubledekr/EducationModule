Research shows that most diversification benefits (around 90%) are achieved with 15-20 stocks, after which adding more stocks provides minimal additional risk reduction. This is because you can diversify away company-specific risk but not market-wide (systematic) risk."

A better approach examines dividend safety using metrics like interest coverage ratios (>2.0), debt-to-equity (<50%), and free cash flow coverage (>1.2)."
